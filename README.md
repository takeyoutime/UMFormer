## Overview framework of UMFormer

We aim to design a precise semantic segmentation network for remote sensing images. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism and Mamba, we propose UMFormer, a network that fuses these two techniques within an encoder-decoder framework to address the aforementioned challenges. UMFormer combines the respective advantages of CNN, self-attention mechanism and Mamba to create a hybrid network effectively.

## Comparison of network parameters

In the context of remote sensing image semantic segmentation, the parameter size, complexity and speed of the network are also crucial evaluation indicators. In response, a comparison is made between UMFormer and efficient semantic segmentation networks, including the number of model parameters (M), the floating point operation count (FLOPs) and the frames per second (FPS).
